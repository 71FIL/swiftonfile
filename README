Gluster For Swift - Integrating GlusterFS with OpenStack Swift Implementation
of the Swift API. This is a component of the Unified File and Object (UFO)
story for GlusterFS, which allows files and directories created via
gluster-native/nfs/samba mount(s) to be accessed as accounts, containers and
objects.

Install
  * yum install openstack-swift*.noarch
  * yum install gluster-swift-1.3*.noarch

Once this is done, you can access GlusterFS volumes via the Swift API where
accounts are mounted volumes (today), containers are top-level directories,
and objects are files and sub-directories of container directories.

Command to start the servers (TBD)
